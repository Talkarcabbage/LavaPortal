Tired of chunk loaders and ender tanks polluting your server's performance? Flowing lava and pump management not the source of your entertainment?

Lava is one of those liquids that comes useful in a variety of vanilla MineCraft applications as well as technological and magic based mods. Unfortunately, it often requires a visit to the nether or an underground lava lake to obtain. Some choose to innovate with chunk loaders and automated pumps, but this proves to be an annoying setup.

With Lava Portals, say goodbye to the nether. Harnessing the power of traditional nether portals supplemented by that of enderman teleportation, lava portals generate a two-by-two meter inexhaustible pool of lava in a way not unlike that of water by pulling the lava from the infiniteness of the nether.

Disclaimer: The lava produced by this mod appears from thin air and is not correlated to the existence of lava in the nether. The nether does not need to be loaded nor exist for proper mod function.

The main purpose of this mod is to allow lava generation without using a pump and teleportation system, saving on server resources, as it does not require a chunkloaded and is relatively efficient in comparison.
